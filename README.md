# PremarPregChildbirth
Replication files for my paper on the effect of premarital pregnancy on second childbearing

There are 8 do files (+master dofile) to run the replication.

0.Master - a do file that runs other do files

1.DataConst - a do file that creates dataset for analysis

2.Expand - a do file that expands the dataset 

3.OccupationHistory - a do file that creates a time varying occulational variables

4.Labeling.do- a do file that creates variable/value labels

5.Descriptive - a do file that submits descriptive statistics

6.PSMatching.do - a do file that runs propensity score matching

7.KMEstimation.do- a do file that shows the results of Kaplan-Meier Estimation

8.Multivariate.do - a do file that examines the multivariate analysis with predicted values

Output files are included in the Results folder.

I thank Ryota Mugiyama for sharing his codes to create the time varying occupational variables.
